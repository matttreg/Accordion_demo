<button class="accordion">Suggested answer to the the pre-reading task 3</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There are two factors that greatly affect UK daily habits:</p>

<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Women usually do more unpaid work at home such as cleaning or taking care of children.</p>

<p><strong>Place where we live:</strong> The commute to work may be longer or shorter depending on where we work. For example, people spend longer commuting in London than in other regions in the UK</p>

<p>Your answers to the pre-reading tasks were maybe different from the text itself. Thatâ€™s absolutely fine. The important point is to start thinking about the text before reading so that you can focus your reading and get less distracted by unknown vocabulary. Using pre-reading tasks such as the ones we have done here is a very useful way of helping your learners develop their reading skills.</p>
